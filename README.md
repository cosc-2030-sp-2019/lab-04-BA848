Distinguish between Binary Search, a binary tree, and a binary search tree.

Binary Search- 	
	Can also be identified as a half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop. It is a search algorithm
	that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. a Binary search compares the target value 
	to the middle elements of the array. 

Binary Tree-
	Quite self explanatory, a binary tree is a tree data structure where each parent node(contains key values)
	has at most two children.These "children" are referred to as the left node and the right node which can either 
	be empty or have a left and/or right node of their own. Binary trees can be described as full, complete, or "flat."
	A full binary tree means that each node has two or zero "children." A complete binary tree is depicted when 
	all levels of nodes except the last have 2 children filled in from the left. A "flat" tree is depicted when 
	only the left or only the left nodes exist.  

Binary Search Tree(BST)-
	Can also be identified as an ordered binary tree, a BST is depicted by ordering/sorting data in nodes
	containing key values. The properties of a BST include that in any subtree if the keys are less than the
	root key value then they are in the left subtree, and if the keys are greater than the root key value then they
	are in the right subtree.  Insertion of new values is simple to follow the trail of less than or greater then. 
	The new node is inserted in exactly one place, but given a set of key values, there are more than one possible 
	binary search trees. Deletion of nodes can be quite complicated when translating into code, more to be discovered.
